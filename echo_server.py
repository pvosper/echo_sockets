Internet Programming in Python: Session 01

Homework

Your homework assignment for this week is to take what you've learned here and
build a simple "echo" server.

The server should automatically return to any client that connects exactly what
it receives (it should echo all messages).

You will also write a python script that, when run, will send a message to the
server and receive the reply, printing it to stdout.

Finally, you'll do all of this so that it can be tested.

Notes:

    - Server will echo but not accumulate messages
    - KeyboardInterrupt works with control-c
    - More comments than code :-P

    #       a TCP socket with IPv4 Addressing, call the socket you make 'sock'
